# GLPI Customization Plugin

## INFO
**GLPI version support starting from 9.5.8**

For older version support (< 9.5.8) head over to the original repository.
For newer version support (> 9.5.x) switch to main branch or download the release from the release page

This repository is a fork
of [https://github.com/stdonato/glpi-modifications](https://github.com/stdonato/glpi-modifications). As the original
owner of this repository does not continue to support future versions of GLPI, we decided to maintain it.
We have rewritten most of the code but the functionalities stay more or less the same.

This plugin and it's maintainers are not connected to the GLPI project in any way.

## FEATURE LIST

- replace GLPI logo of login page and menu with custom logo
- add background to login page
